        <p>
          Pompompurin (ポムポムプリン, Pomupomupurin) is a good-natured Golden
          Retriever dog character introduced by the Japanese company Sanrio in
          1996. Purin was born on a sunny day on April 16th. Pompompurin lives
          in his own basket in the entrance hall of his sister-owner's house.
          His trademark is his brown beret that is always on top of his head.
          Pompompurin's favorite food is his mama's pudding.

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        Pompompurin's interest is collecting shoes, which includes his
        owner-father's leather shoes, one of his owner-mother's sandal, etc. He
        likes to hide them. Pompompurin loves drinking milk and eating cream
        caramel pudding that his mother makes. He also spends a lot of time
        sleeping (one could say he has a talent for it!), doing 'purin
        aerobics,' and hanging out with his best friends. He's a laidback dog
        who loves soft stuff and easily makes friends. He dreams of being even
        bigger. He perks up when he hears his owners say "Let's go out!" and
        he'd rather not hear "Stay!" Pompompurin's best friends include a
        hamster called Muffin, a mouse named Scone, and a bird named Custard who
        loves to steal Pompompurin's hat and perch on his head. He secretly
        likes it when the wind blows Pompompurin's beret off, so he can retrieve
        it!
